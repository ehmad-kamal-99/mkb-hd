Microservices Architecture
Benefits:
- Testing
- Maintainability
- Deployment


- PROS
- Highly maintainable and testable
- Loosely coupled
- Independently deployable
- Organized around business capabilities
- Owned by a small team


- CONS
- Inter-service communication and partial failure (How is it done and how to tackle it)
- Request spanning multiple services is difficult (How is it done???)
- Testing becomes difficult (How?)
- Deployment becomes difficult because too many services (Really??)
- When you use microservices you have to work on automated deployment, monitoring, dealing with failure,
eventual consistency, and other factors that a distributed system introduces.

Microservice with Shared Database versus separate database.
