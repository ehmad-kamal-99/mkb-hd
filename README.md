my knowledge base - high definition :)

TMI for me when I dive into a topic and end up with 30+ tabs. To avoid it, I gather chunks of information and place into directories and then sort it over time.

It definitely is in its initial state. Much like monolith :) the boundaries are not clear yet. I have a lot of things going on + the time required to structure and organize it properly, I dont have it. So I essentially jot stuff and place them in directories that makes the most sense at that time.

Hopefully this will become a base for me to look back on and really revise concepts and decisions I make over time.

Content:
You can find articles and code for pass-by-value vs pass-by-reference or arrays vs slices, to leetcode problems and interesting topics like how monolith-first approach is better than jumping directly into microservices (it depends).
