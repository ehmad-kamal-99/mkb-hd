Docker (Overlay FS)
- Volume Mounting and how it's done.
- Dockerfile vs Docker-Compose
- Types of mounting (there might be multiple types)
- Networking
- Multi-Level Builds (Generate build, install tools i.e. golang, ca-certs then use that build using from in another stage/level leaving other stuff behind)

Know the basic resources like
- Nodes (virtual machine on which pods gets created)
- Pods (contains application containers or other)
- Persistent Volume (Volume where data is stored, is mapped to something physical i.e. s3, or nfs etc.)
- Persistent Volume Claim (used for replica sets, an abstract requirement of what is needed, not physical definition.)
- Storage Class (dynamic persistent volume creation as opposed to manually creating somewhere and setting ips etc)
- Config-Maps (store application or db configuration files, available to your pod and can be mapped to container)
- Secrets (certificates for server or databases, available to your pod and can be mapped to container)
- emptyDir or tempVolume, directory present on node/machine, sharing its lifespan with pods and used for caching/temp data.
