Important Concepts of SQL Databases.

- Relationships in Databases (o-o, o-m, m-m)
- Normalizations and its types. (1nf, 2nf, 3nf)
- Joins, types of joins, why and when to use them. (self, equi, inner, outer)
- Design a databased model for a scenario. (How about hierarchical data).
- Indexing in databases. How is it done. When can you benefit from it. What are the costs?
- Remember DDL (create tables/databases), DML (modify data i.e. crud), DCL (manager control access to databases)
- ACID properties.
- Types of constraints.
- Stored Procedures and its advantages plus triggers.
- Database Replica Sets vs Sharding.
- Clustered vs Non-Clustered Index. Types of indexes and when to use which?
- SQL vs PL/SQL. (Oracles Procedural Language to write a full program (loops, variables) to accomplish multiple CRUD's)
