gRPC vs REST

Speed: gRPC works with HTTP 2.0, transfers binary files as opposed to JSON/XML files in REST which is in text form and
is larger and slower. (gRPC 1-0 REST)

Flexibility: 10 clients, change in REST API (add / remove fields), you need to update the clients as well. in gRPC, you
create proto file (a template on which generated code will be based) and you can easily recompile to accommodate change.
gRPC proto file consists of methods and messages for your API Handlers. (gRPC 2-0 REST)

Compatability: gRPC supports lots of popular languages but not some that might be unpopular but you can use gRPC gateway
to create REST API based on your gRPC proto-buffer. (gRPC 2-1 REST)
